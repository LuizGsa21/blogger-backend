# blogger-backend

Rebuilding the back-end for [Programming Tutorials](https://ptutorials.mypassion.io/). 

Blogger allows client applications to create new blog posts, edit or delete existing posts, and query for posts that match particular criteria... and much more to come.

Work in progress.

A client application is also being built, [click here](https://github.com/LuizGsa21/blogger-frontend) :)
